project-ideas
=============

This repository is for Fashioning Circuits students to share and discuss their final project ideas.  Ideas for Fall 2013 projects (about a paragraph long, preferably with rationale and links to supplementary material) and edits to ideas should be added to f13-ideas.md and submitted via pull request.  This will require you to fork this repository to your own account, make edits and commits there, then submit those commits to us.  Discussion and suggestions regarding ideas should be submitted via this repository's issue tracker.

.md is the file extension for Markdown, a document language that allows for faster and more lightweight composition than HTML or other formatted document files.  We recommend reading through [John Gruber's Markdown Basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics "Markdown: Basics") and [GitHub's guide to how they parse Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown "GitHub-flavored Markdown") before adding your submission.

Please submit your ideas before midnight on Wednesday, September 26.  If you're having trouble with Git or GitHub, contact Harrison with questions.

Instructions
------------

If you need them, here's some step-by-step instructions for completing the assignment.  You are encouraged to try working it out yourself based on the knowledge you gained from the readings, but if you're having trouble, follow these steps.

1. Install a good text editor.  For Windows, [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.4.5.html) is good.  For Mac, give [TextMate](http://macromates.com/download) a try.
1. Press the fork button at the top right of this repository while logged into your GitHub account.  This will copy the repository to your GitHub account.
1. Use the Git app you downloaded to clone the repository.  If you're using one of the official GitHub apps, just select the repository and clone it to your local machine.  If you're using a different application, you'll have to use the URL found in the sidebar of your fork of the repository.
1. Find the folder where you saved your clone of the repository and open the f13-ideas.md file in the text editor of your choice.  Add your paragraph to the end.  Make sure there's a blank line between your parargraph and the previous one so that they'll be treated as separate.
1. Commit your changes.  If using the GitHub app, you just need to commit and sync your changes.  Otherwise, "add" the changed file, commit it, then push the commit to "origin" (GitHub).
1. Create a pull request.  Open this repository (the original) in GitHub and press the "pull request" button.  Select your repository as the source and this repository as the destination.  Add a brief note about your request, then press submit.  If it doesn't have any formatting problems, Kim or Harrison will accept the pull request, and your changes will be integrated into the original repository.
