project-ideas
=============

This repository is for Fashioning Circuits students to share and discuss their final project ideas.  Ideas for Fall 2013 projects (about a paragraph long, preferably with rationale and links to supplementary material) and edits to ideas should be added to f13-ideas.md and submitted via pull request.  This will require you to fork this repository to your own account, make edits and commits there, then submit those commits to us.  Discussion and suggestions regarding ideas should be submitted via this repository's issue tracker.

.md is the file extension for Markdown, a document language that allows for faster and more lightweight composition than HTML or other formatted document files.  We recommend reading through [John Gruber's Markdown Basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics "Markdown: Basics") and [GitHub's guide to how they parse Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown "GitHub-flavored Markdown") before adding your submission.

Please submit your ideas before midnight on Monday, September 23.  If you're having trouble with Git or GitHub, contact Harrison with questions.
